# Streamlit Digit Ensemble 🎯

A handwritten digit recognition application built with **scikit-learn pipelines**
and **ensemble learning (Voting Classifier)**, featuring an interactive
**Streamlit** user interface.

This project supports **training models, saving/loading them, and predicting
digits from user-uploaded images**.

## ✨ Features
- Data normalization using `StandardScaler`
- Dimensionality reduction with `PCA`
- Ensemble learning via `VotingClassifier`
- Interactive UI built with Streamlit
- Save and load trained models (`.pkl` / `.joblib`)
- Detect and predict multiple digits from a single image
